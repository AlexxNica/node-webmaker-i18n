node-webmaker-i18n
==================

Webmaker Localization Components for node.js and the browser.

This code is heavily inspired by, and borrows from, [Mozilla's i18n-abide](https://github.com/mozilla/i18n-abide) project.
However, this code has been stripped down to support only those things needed by the Webmaker tools and apps, and is based on
JSON instead of PO files, uses a different form of client-side localization, etc.
